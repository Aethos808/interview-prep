This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping interval. In a lot if problems involving intervals,
we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge if they overlap.

Given two intervals (a and b), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

1. a and b do not overlap
2. a and b overlap b ends after a
3. a completely overlaps b
4. a and b overlap, a ends after b
5. be completely overlaps a
6. a and b do not overlap

Understanding the above six cases will help us in solving all intervals related problems.

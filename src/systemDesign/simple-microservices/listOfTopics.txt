- hosting in aws
    - set up networking
        - buying domain     <--------- Left off here (take a look at prices for domain and traffic)
        - dns               <------|
        - vpc
        - subnets
        - security groups
    - set up in ECS and ECR
    - create terraform as a backup
- set up CICD (in GHA, or Jenkins)
    - create merge/deployment plan
    - create rollback plan
    - test deployments
    - set up terraform backup
- host relevant data in some db (should probably do one SQL db and one NOSQL db)
    - maybe AWS Aurora?
    - add CICD job to remove stuff from db safely
- maybe later move to hosting in kubernetes?
    - local testing of kubernetes environment
    - set up EKS
    - update CICD to reflect the new deployment location and structure

- **nice to haves**
    - use helm with kubernetes configuration
    - rewrite service to use AWS Lambda




To set up AWS API Gateway with a new ECS cluster, you will need to follow these steps:
***I messed up 2. === 1. ***

2. Create an ECS cluster: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the ECS service and create a new cluster. 
   You will need to give the cluster a name and select the region in which you want to create it.

3. Create a task definition: A task definition is a blueprint that describes how a container should be deployed and run. 
   You can create a task definition by using the ECS console, or by using the AWS CLI or SDK.

4. Register the task definition: Once you have created a task definition, you will need to register it with your ECS cluster. 
   This will make the task available to be run on the container instances in your cluster.

5. Create a service: A service is used to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition. 
   You can create a service by using the ECS console, or by using the AWS CLI or SDK.

6. Create an API Gateway: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the API Gateway service and create a new API.

7. Create a resource and method: Once your API is created, you will need to create a resource and method for your API. 
   This is where you will specify the path for your API and the type of request it will handle (e.g. GET, POST, etc.).

8. Connect the API Gateway to your ECS service: After you have created your resource and method, you will need to connect it to your 
   ECS service. This is done by creating an "Integration" between the API Gateway
